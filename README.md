## üöÄ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get your Fitness-Tracker application up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (includes npm)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    First, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/asthabisoi28/Fitness-Tracker.git
    cd Fitness-Tracker
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary Node.js packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command will install `express`, `cors`, `body-parser`, `sqlite3`, and `path` as specified in `package.json`.

3.  **Database Setup:**
    The application uses an SQLite database (`fitness_tracker.db`). If this file does not exist or needs initialization, you might need to run a setup script. Refer to `setup.md` for specific database initialization instructions if provided.

    ```bash
    # If setup.md contains specific database initialization commands
    # You might need to run something like:
    # npm run setup-db
    # or consult setup.md for manual steps.
    ```

4.  **Start the Server:**
    Once all dependencies are installed and the database is ready, you can start the Node.js server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This command typically runs `server.js` and starts the backend service.


## üí° Usage Examples

After starting the server, the Fitness-Tracker application will be accessible via your web browser.

1.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to:

    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

    (The port might vary if specified differently in `server.js` or environment variables).

2.  **Basic Interaction:**
    *   **Log Activities:** Use the interface to input your daily exercises, meals, and other health metrics.
    *   **View Progress:** Navigate to the dashboard or progress section to see your data visualized through charts.
    *   **Set Goals:** Define new fitness goals and track your journey towards achieving them.
